# Frequency dynamics with inverters: proof of stabilizability and existence of Nash equilibrium

This repository aims to provide data and control schemes that are shown in the paper: P. Serna-Torre and P. Hidalgo-Gonzalez, "Frequency dynamics with inverters: proof of stabilizability and existence of Nash equilibrium". If you want to use any material of this repository, please we would appreciate if you cite our paper and this repository in your work. 

- 12-bus power system under Conventional Frequency Regulation (CFR). It provides input data in the ".m" file and the simulink file. The simulink file has the synchronous generators with primary and secondary frequency regulation schemes. The IBR are set up to inject a constant power.
- 12-bus power system under Non-cooperative Game Theory-based framework.  It provides input data in the ".m" file and the simulink file.  The simulink file has the synchronous generators and IBR participating in frequency regulation jointly.
